# julia-workshop-2019

An advanced [Julia](https://julialang.org/) workshop for undergraduate/graduate physicists which will take place in summer 2019 at the [University of Cologne](https://www.portal.uni-koeln.de/index.php?id=9441&L=1). Although the course is building upon [CompPhys-2019](https://github.com/trebst/compphys-2019) only rudimentary Julia knowledge should be required to follow along.

Julia installation instructions are available (in german) on the [computer physics course website](http://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/trebst/Lectures/2019-CompPhys.shtml). The instructions at the MIT math department, [julia-mit](https://github.com/mitmath/julia-mit), might be useful as well.

Course instructor: [Carsten Bauer](https://github.com/crstnbr)
