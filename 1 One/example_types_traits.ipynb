Since types are known at compile time (remember, functions specialize on types), the dispatch of `likes_music` is known at compile-time. But this means, since the result is directly inferred from the dispatch, the boolean value `true/false` is known at compile time. This means that the compiler can directly infer the answer to all of these checks, and will use this information to skip them at runtime.\n",

Therefore using this \"action-based design\", we are actually giving the compiler leeway to perform many extra optimizations on our code as long as we define our interfaces by the actions that are used. Of course, at the \"very bottom\" our algorithms have to use the fields of the types, but the full interface can then be built up using a simple set of functions which in many cases with replace runtime data with constants."
